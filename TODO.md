# Diffusion Models 101

This repository has educational purpose only. It is based on the work done by Ryota Kawamura [Github repo](https://github.com/Ryota-Kawamura/How-Diffusion-Models-Work). I experimented experiment with the code and labs presented in Deeplearning AI's [How Diffusion Models Work](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/how-diffusion-models-work/).Sharon Zhou

In How Diffusion Models Work, you will gain a deep familiarity with the diffusion process and the models which carry it out. More than simply pulling in a pre-built model or using an API, this course will teach you to build a diffusion model from scratch.

- tried different noise scheduler


- get GPU performance from Pytorch and Pynvml (from Nvidia's driver)


- noise scheduler: cosine (https://betterprogramming.pub/diffusion-models-ddpms-ddims-and-classifier-free-guidance-e07b297b2869#0caf)
